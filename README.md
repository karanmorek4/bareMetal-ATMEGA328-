# Bare-Metal-ATMEGA328

   What is Bare Metal Programming ?
   
   Baremetal programming is a technique of programming microcontrollers without using any operating system or other software layer. 
   It allows developers to directly access the hardware and write programs that execute on the microcontroller without any intermediate layer.
   
   The importance of baremetal programming lies in its ability to provide more control and lower-level access to hardware resources. 
   This can lead to faster and more efficient execution of code, which is particularly important in real-time applications where timing is critical.
